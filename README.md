# dist-s1-prod-check

Validation checks for the OPERA DIST-S1 production system. Cross-references product metadata
(GeoTIFF tags), NASA CMR granule metadata, and the expected enumeration from
[dist-s1-enumerator](https://github.com/opera-adt/dist-s1-enumerator) at global scale.

## Checks

1. **download-metadata** - DIST-S1 + RTC-S1 granule metadata from CMR into geoparquet tables
   (direct CMR queries, temporally chunked and threaded; no per-product API calls).
2. **check-duplicates** - DIST-S1 granules sharing the same tile/acquisition. The last-processed
   granule of a group is taken as the correct one; every other check runs on that granule only.
3. **check-ordering** - processing order matches acquisition order within each MGRS tile. Each
   product is compared against the previous acquisition in its tile, and reprocessed acquisitions
   are excluded (their retained version is processed late by construction, which would otherwise
   flag both it and everything acquired after it in the tile — a duplicate masquerading as an
   ordering failure).
4. **check-confirmation** - each product's `prior_dist_s1_product` tag points to the previous
   product in its tile time series.
5. **check-inputs** - recorded pre/post RTC-S1 inputs match a re-enumeration
   (`--mode offline` re-enumerates from the local RTC table; `--mode online` hits ASF per product).
6. **check-coverage** - every RTC-S1 pass with baseline imagery has a DIST-S1 product.

Each check writes timestamped CSVs (all results + failures with expected vs. actual) and an
HTML report with a clickable map of failing MGRS tiles (popups show product ids, reasons, and
layer links) and filterable tables with CSV export. `run-all` produces one combined report.

## Setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash   # if pixi is missing
pixi install
```

Earthdata credentials are required (the DIST-S1 CMR collection and the DAAC GeoTIFFs are
gated): put them in `~/.netrc` (`machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov login ... password ...`) or
let `earthaccess.login()` prompt once.

## Weekend run (checks 1-6, global, Jan-Mar 2026)

```bash
pixi shell
nohup dist-s1-prod-check run-all --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01 \
    --data-dir data --out-dir outputs > run_all.log 2>&1 &
```

Everything heavy is resumable: metadata tables are only re-downloaded with `--refresh`, tag
fetching (one DAAC read per product, ~230k globally) caches to `data/dist_s1_tags.parquet`, and
the offline inputs check checkpoints per tile to `data/inputs_check_results.parquet` — a rerun
of the same command picks up where it left off. The inputs check runs in `--inputs-workers`
processes (default 8; raise on a many-core server). `--refresh` clears the inputs checkpoint
along with the metadata tables since results depend on the RTC table. CSVs are written as each
check completes and the HTML report is written even if a later check fails, so a crash never
discards finished work.

Over an AOI instead:

```bash
dist-s1-prod-check run-all --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01 --bbox -120 34 -118 36
```

**UAT venue** (DIST-S1 products delivered to ASF UAT, e.g. from a test-venue replay):

```bash
dist-s1-prod-check run-all --venue UAT --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01 \
    --data-dir data_uat --out-dir outputs_uat
```

Only DIST-S1 metadata and GeoTIFF tags come from UAT; RTC-S1 inputs are still read from PROD CMR.
Requires a `machine uat.urs.earthdata.nasa.gov` entry in `~/.netrc`. Each data dir is tied to one venue
(`venue.txt`), since PROD and UAT can hold products with the same ids. If the UAT run did not cover the
whole globe, pass `--bbox` so the coverage check does not flag every unprocessed tile.

**Fast iteration on a sample** (reuses all serialized data; seconds-to-minutes per run):

```bash
dist-s1-prod-check run-all --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01 \
    --data-dir data_global --out-dir outputs_sample --sample-tiles 100
```

`--sample-tiles N` restricts every check to N random MGRS tiles but keeps each tile's full
product time series, so chain-based checks (confirmation, ordering, coverage) stay valid.
Same `--seed` (default 42) means the same tiles every run; change it to see different ones.
Tags fetched for the sample land in the shared cache, so the eventual full run reuses them.

Individual checks after `download-metadata` / `fetch-tags`:

```bash
dist-s1-prod-check download-metadata --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01
dist-s1-prod-check fetch-tags --workers 16
dist-s1-prod-check check-duplicates
dist-s1-prod-check check-ordering
dist-s1-prod-check check-confirmation
dist-s1-prod-check check-inputs            # offline, uses the RTC table
dist-s1-prod-check check-inputs --mode online --sample 100   # recent products, live ASF
dist-s1-prod-check check-coverage --start 2026-01-01 --stop 2026-03-01
```

## Notebooks

```bash
pixi run jupyter lab
```

- `notebooks/0_download_and_check.ipynb` - the full workflow as library calls.
- `notebooks/1_investigate_aoi.ipynb` - products + RTC inputs over a bbox.

## Memory at global scale

CMR pages are parsed and discarded as they stream in (never accumulated as raw JSON), the
inputs check enumerates and compares one MGRS tile at a time, and coverage groups are
prefiltered to the check window. Measured: 680 B/row for the RTC table, so the global Jan-Mar
2026 run peaks around 12-16 GB (RTC table ~5 GB + LUT-joined frame ~7 GB + bounded transients).

## Notes

- AOI runs resolve the bbox to its overlapping MGRS tiles and widen the RTC-S1 query to the
  full burst footprints of those tiles (stored in `data/target_mgrs_tiles.txt`); without this,
  edge products appear to use "unexpected" inputs. Antimeridian-crossing AOIs are not handled.
- The first product per tile inside the queried window cannot have its prior validated
  (the true prior falls before the window); it is skipped unless `--expect-none-at-start`
  (mission-start semantics) is passed.
- The HTML report loads Leaflet and basemap tiles from CDNs, so it needs internet when opened;
  all data is embedded in the file.
- Coverage baseline logic mirrors the enumerator defaults: lookback windows at 365/730/1095
  days, 60-day width, max 4/3/3 pre-images per burst, min 1.
- **Polarization**: only dual-polarization RTC-S1 (`VV+VH`, `HH+HV`) is ever used - single-pol
  granules are dropped when the RTC input frame is built and are never post-images or baseline
  imagery. A burst's baseline must also match its post-image: a `VV+VH` post-image can only be
  paired with `VV+VH` pre-images, and likewise for `HH+HV`. Coverage counts a burst as having a
  baseline only when the lookback windows hold same-polarization acquisitions, and the inputs
  check reports `Pre RTC baseline polarization mismatch` / `Single polarization input used` for
  products that violate this.
